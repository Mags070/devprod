## Basic Utility: Number Summation Function

This document details a simple JavaScript code snippet that defines and demonstrates a basic function for summing two numbers.

---

### 1. Overview

The provided code defines a single function, `test`, which performs the fundamental arithmetic operation of addition on two input numbers. It then immediately showcases the usage of this function by calculating the sum of `1` and `2` and printing the result to the console.

### 2. Function Details

#### `test(a, b)`

*   **Description**: This function takes two numerical arguments and returns their sum. It is a straightforward implementation of addition.
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `a` (Number): The first number to be added.
    *   `b` (Number): The second number to be added.
*   **Returns**: (Number) The calculated sum of `a` and `b`.
*   **Example Usage**:

    ```javascript
    let sum1 = test(5, 3);   // sum1 will be 8
    let sum2 = test(-10, 20); // sum2 will be 10
    let sum3 = test(0.5, 0.25); // sum3 will be 0.75
    ```

### 3. Execution Example

The code snippet includes a direct invocation of the `test` function with specific arguments and immediately logs the output to the console. This serves as a direct demonstration of the function's utility.

#### Code Snippet:

```javascript
console.log(test(1, 2));
```

#### Explanation:

1.  `test(1, 2)`: The `test` function is called with `a = 1` and `b = 2`.
2.  The function returns `1 + 2`, which evaluates to `3`.
3.  `console.log(3)`: The value `3` is then printed to the standard output (typically the terminal or browser console).

#### Expected Output:

```
3
```

### 4. How to Run

To execute this code and observe its output:

1.  **Save the code**: Save the provided JavaScript code into a file, for example, `sum_example.js`.
2.  **Using Node.js**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run:
    ```bash
    node sum_example.js
    ```
    You will see `3` printed to your console.
3.  **In a Web Browser**:
    *   Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) with the following content:
        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>Sum Example</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <script>
                // Defines a function to sum two numbers.
                function test(a, b) {
                    return a + b;
                }

                // Calls the test function with specific arguments and logs the output to the console.
                console.log(test(1, 2));
            </script>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
    *   Open `index.html` in any web browser.
    *   Open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing `F12` or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" and then navigating to the "Console" tab).
    *   You will see `3` displayed in the console.
